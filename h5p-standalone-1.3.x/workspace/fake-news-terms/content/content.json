These pages are usually rife with advertisements.\n\n*Post-truth*: The Oxford English Dictionary defines this as &#039;relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping political debate or public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief&#039;.\n\n*Disinformation*: A deliberate attempt to spread false information. Designed to be widely shared, its purpose is often to persuade people to think or vote a certain way, or to make money from advertising accompanying it.\n\n*Misinformation*: False information which may also be shared widely and quickly, but in this instance the author was unaware the information was untrue.\n\n*Junk Science*: Ideas and theories that seem to be well researched and scientific but in fact have little evidence to support them. \n\n*Hate News*: Sources that actively promote lies encouraging racism, misogyny, homophobia and other forms of discrimination."}
